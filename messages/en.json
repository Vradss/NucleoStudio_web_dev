    "label": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "title": "FAQS",
    "faq1": {
      "question": "When should I choose a one-time project vs a monthly plan?",
      "answer": "One-time project: If you need to clarify your value proposition once and your team will execute the content afterwards. Ideal for launches, defining your campaign messages, repositioning because your value proposition evolved, or when you prefer a closed deliverable without monthly commitment.\n\nMonthly plan: If you already have clear positioning and messages but need to execute consistent content without building a team, or you want a partner that handles strategy and content end-to-end."
    },
    "faq2": {
      "question": "Can I pay for just 1 month of the content plans?",
      "answer": "Of course, it's possible. Just make sure to choose \"monthly\" to update the prices. Download the complete content catalog here to see what content we can create for you [/pricing#comparison-section]"
    },
    "faq3": {
      "question": "Do you specialize in any type of B2B companies?",
      "answer": "Yes, we work with startups in education, financial services, B2B ecommerce, and consulting firms in technology, science, innovation and/or executive training.\n\nThey usually have these characteristics: long sales cycles (>1 month), high tickets, have products that are difficult to understand or are in a new category (Example: AI)"
    },
    "faq4": {
      "question": "How does monthly content execution work?",
      "answer": "In the STARTER plan you prioritize the content you need each month. In the PRO and FRACTIONAL plans we help you with planning and execution. Download the complete content catalog here [/pricing#pricing-section]"
    },
    "faq5": {
      "question": "What if I don't have clarity on my target segment or my differentiation?",
      "answer": "Our one-time positioning projects or Fractional plan are for you. Includes:\n→ Customer interviews to understand why they choose you\n→ Competitive analysis to identify where to win\n→ Workshops to define your positioning\n\nYou don't need clarity before starting. Our process helps you discover it."
    },
    "faq6": {
      "question": "Do I need to have a marketing team to work with you?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily.\n\nSome clients have been CEOs or founders without a marketing team and start defining positioning before investing in marketing or with a LinkedIn strategy and delegate execution.\n\nIn other cases, there are marketing managers who already have a clear strategy and want execution support."
    },
    "faq7": {
      "question": "How long does it take to see results?",
      "answer": "It depends on the type of plan you choose.\n\nThe fastest result: clarity in your value proposition and marketing messages. Clients mention that their team knows exactly what to say after the first sessions.\n\nThis directly impacts all your active marketing actions and their key metrics."
    },
    "faq8": {
      "question": "What if I don't like the copy or content you create?",
      "answer": "We work collaboratively:\n→ All strategies are reviewed together in 1:1 sessions\n→ Unlimited revisions included\n→ We validate with your sales team.\n\nIf your team doesn't feel comfortable selling with the message, we adjust it unlimited times. The goal is not for you to like it, it's to help you with your main objective."
    },
    "faq9": {
      "question": "What happens after a one-time project? Can I continue with a monthly plan?",
      "answer": "Yes. It's the most common path. After finishing your one-time project, you can choose a content plan (Starter, Pro or Fractional) according to your priorities and budget."
    },
    "faq10": {
      "question": "Why should I invest in positioning and content now instead of waiting?",
      "answer": "Every month without clarity you're losing sales because:\n→ Your team doesn't know how to communicate your value (longer cycles)\n→ Prospects don't understand your difference (you lose deals)\n→ Your content doesn't generate qualified leads.\n\nClients who clarified their positioning report:\n→ 30-50% less time explaining their proposal\n→ More confidence from the sales team\n→ Better lead quality.\n\nThe cost of NOT having clarity is greater than the investment."
    },
    "faq11": {
      "question": "Okay, but... what exactly do you do in Product & Content Marketing?",
      "answer": "Let's start with product marketing: it's the FOUNDATION of all B2B marketing. Without a clear value proposition, all marketing efforts are weak.\n\nIn B2B tech, it's the backbone, especially when your products have technical complexity. Everything else is built on those foundations.\n\nProduct marketing: Define WHAT to say about your product to differentiate yourself and have your ICP understand it in 30 seconds. It's the clarity that makes all your marketing work.\n\nB2B Content marketing: Use that clarity to create content that attracts educated leads. It's not 'posting for posting' – it's amplifying your value proposition so prospects arrive saying 'I already understand what you do, let's talk to learn more'."
